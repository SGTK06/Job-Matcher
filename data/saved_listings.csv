Oliv.AI is a SalesTech global startup headquartered in San Francisco, debuting the world's first team of AI Agents for sales. With our recent $5.2M Seed funding, we solve one of the biggest problems for revenue teams: unreliable deal data. Oliv captures Deal Intelligence from every meeting, call, and email—without any rep involvement. The result is a clear, detailed view of every deal, presented in scorecards built on trusted sales methodologies like MEDDICC, BANT, and SPICED. Our AI agents are built for sales teams—sales managers, AEs, and RevOps—handling the work that takes them away from selling. With Oliv AI, sales teams can bring back focus on deals, strategy and conversation.About the role:
This isn’t a PM role; it’s a Founder-in-Residence opportunity for someone who thrives on ambiguity, outthinks LLMs, and can architect a product strategy while sprinting alongside engineers. If you’re razor-sharp, obsessive about metrics, and bored by playbooks.
What you’ll do:

Own the Agentic Workflow: Design AI-driven SalesTech systems that act autonomously to resolve bottlenecks in deal closures, no babysitting.
Solve for Cognitive Density: Translate chaotic sales pipelines into elegant, AI-first UX. Think “Co-Pilot for Closers”.
Focused on driving adoption and/or design first mindset.
Ship at Warp Speed: Prioritize like a chess grandmaster. Launch MVPs in days, not months, then iterate with cold, metric-driven precision.
Outthink the Market: Reverse-engineer GTM strategies for a category that doesn’t exist yet
Lead with Code: Partner directly with engineers to hack prototypes (SQL, Python, or Figma).

What we need:

Cognitive Agility: Aced competitive environments (debate/Olympiads) or built non-trivial projects while excelling academically; think in first principles, not playbooks.
Academic Pedigree: Tier 1/2 grad or scaled a startup/ side hustle with measurable impact.
AI-First Instincts: 2+ years shipping B2B SaaS where AI/ML was core to the product (not just a feature).
Founder DNA: Thrive in chaos, rebuild broken systems, and default to action over meetings.

What we offer:

Highly competitive compensation package from US VC funded startup
Compensation package also includes meaningful equity with terms you'll actually be able to benefit from
Unlimited paid time off, sick leave, and a flexible remote WFH workplace #LI-remote
All the tools you need to succeed including a new Macbook
Flexible work hours because we want you to work your best way
We help our team build their career and unleash their potential - we foster top talent and build distinct tailored growth plans which elevate both skills and income

The crushing weight of debt is something that we believe holds people back from reaching their dreams and making a splash in the world. So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial. 
Over the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And we’ve been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we’ve raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.
But at our core, we’re still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and we’re just getting started..

And to hire the best, we provide the best: great health insurance, competitive salaries, and unique benefits like quarterly meet-ups and access to engagement tools that keep us connected — even from afar.
At Splash, everything we do is guided by our values:
Own It – We take full accountability and follow through on commitments.
Raise the Bar – We move fast, innovate faster, and push through barriers.
Say the Hard Thing – We speak up with honesty, respect, and a desire to solve problems and make things better.
Elevate Each Other – We win as a team by lifting each other up.
These values show up in how we work and how we connect — whether we’re collaborating on big projects or bonding over everyday moments. Yes, we even have Slack channels for #kids-and-pets and #food because we believe being human makes us better teammates.
