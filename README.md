# Job Matcher

A Python-based **Job Matcher** application that helps users discover suitable remote jobs based on their skills and preferences.
The system fetches live job listings, applies an NLP-based matching pipeline, and presents results through an interactive **Streamlit** UI.

---

## Features

- Fetches live remote job listings via the **Remotive API**
- NLP-based skill matching using **spaCy**
- Interactive web UI built with **Streamlit**
- Stores matched jobs locally to avoid duplicates
- Built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with high test coverage

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **UI:** Streamlit
- **NLP:** spaCy (`en_core_web_md`)
- **Data Handling:** Pandas
- **API:** Remotive Jobs API
- **Testing:** unittest, coverage

## Build & Run Instructions

### 1️. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SGTK06/Job-Matcher.git
cd Job-Matcher
```

### 2️. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.12 recommended)

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⏳ Note: Installation may take some time due to NLP and ML-related dependencies.

### 4️. Install spaCy language model

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

### 5️. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Running Tests

(Optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

For coverage:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover tests
coverage report
```
